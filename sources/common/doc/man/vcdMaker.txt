NAME
  vcdMaker - log file to VCD converter
SYNOPSIS
  vcdMaker  [-c line-counter-signal-name] -t s|ms|us|ns|ps|fs [-v] -o output-file
            [--] [--version] [-h] input-file
DESCRIPTION
  vcdMaker is a tool that converts textual log files to VCD trace files.

  Expected log format is as follows:

    #Timestamp TopModule.Module1...ModuleN.SignalName SignalValue <signal-size | f> Comment

  First field is a timestamp in some time unit. Please note that log lines need not to be sorted.

  Second field is a signal name. VCD uses hierarchical signal naming, this structure should be reflected in log line.

  Third field is a signal value.

  Four field is signal size/type. For integer signals signal-size should be a signal size in bits, for real number type code f should be used.

  Last field is a comment, which is ignored.

  Generated log that consists of lines in above format can be transformed to VCD trace and later viewed using any graphical tool, eg. GTKWave.
OPTIONS
  -c, --lineCounter line-counter-signal-name  If given, adds line counter signal with given name. Line counter signal is a signal that can be used to bind timestamp in VCD trace to line number in original log file.
  -t, --timebase s|ms|us|ns|ps|fs             Log timebase specification (required).
  -v, --verbose                               Enables verbose mode.
  -o, --file_out output-file                  Ouput VCD filename (required).
  --, --ignore_rest                           Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.
  --version                                   Displays version information and exits.
  -h, --help                                  Displays usage information and exits.
  input-file                                  Input log filename (required).
