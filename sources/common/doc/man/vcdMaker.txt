NAME
  vcdMaker - log file to VCD converter
SYNOPSIS
  vcdMaker  [-c line-counter-signal-name] -t s|ms|us|ns|ps|fs [-v] -o output-file
            [--] [--version] [-h] input-file
DESCRIPTION
  vcdMaker is a tool that converts textual log files to VCD trace files.

  The expected log format is as follows:

    #Timestamp TopModule.Module1...ModuleN.SignalName SignalValue <signal-size | f | e> Comment

  The first field is a timestamp in some time unit. Please note that log lines need not to be sorted.

  The second field is a signal name. VCD uses hierarchical signal naming, this structure should be reflected in the log line.

  The third field is a signal value. The value is empty for event signals.

  The fourth field is a signal size/type. For integer signals the signal-size should be a signal size in bits, for real number type code 'f' should be used and for event signals type code 'e' should be used.

  The last field is a comment, which is ignored.

  The generated log that consists of lines in the above format can be transformed into a VCD trace and later viewed using any graphical tool, eg. GTKWave.
OPTIONS
  -c, --lineCounter line-counter-signal-name  If given, adds a line counter signal with the given name. The line counter signal is a signal that binds the timestamp in the VCD trace to the line number in original log file.
  -t, --timebase s|ms|us|ns|ps|fs             A log timebase specification (required).
  -v, --verbose                               Enables verbose mode.
  -o, --file_out output-file                  An ouput VCD filename (required).
  --, --ignore_rest                           Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.
  --version                                   Displays the version information and exits.
  -h, --help                                  Displays the usage information and exits.
  input-file                                  An input log filename (required).
